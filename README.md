# Preprocessing-Tecniques
This repository explores essential data preprocessing techniques used in machine learning, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling (StandardScaler, RobustScaler), and data cleaning. The goal is to prepare raw datasets into clean, model-ready formats for better performance and reliability.
